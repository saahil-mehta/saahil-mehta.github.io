# Education

Collected three computer-related degrees over nine years. The first one taught me how to install Linux without breaking everything. The second taught me that breaking everything is sometimes the point. The third taught me how to explain why everything broke, in graphs.

Started at polytechnic learning the difference between RAM and hard drives. Ended at Strathclyde with a Master's in Data Analytics, which is what you call statistics when you want to get paid more. My mum has the certificate framed.

## Continuous Learning

Still collecting certifications like Pokémon cards. Currently working on Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer because someone thought I needed more acronyms after my name. Also studying advanced RAG systems and LLM fine-tuning, which is what we called "making things up convincingly" before AI became fashionable.

**Active areas:** MLOps, LLMOps, data observability, AI governance frameworks (ISO 42001), vector databases, and explaining to senior management why we can't just "add blockchain" to fix the data warehouse.
